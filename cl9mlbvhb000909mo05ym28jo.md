### Why does Next JS exist / Why so popular ?

The React Framwork for the Prodution Next Js -> it solved an age-old issue developers had with JavaScript rendering in the browser itself. By doing a lot of the work on the server side, the overall end user experience is greatly improved â€“ but at the same time, Next. js still allows that CSR (One of the methods of Data Fetching).
