So here we go,

2023 is here - Only come in discord (or other socials) on weekends (or only when I publish some new blog or yt video (The link to the blog/video will be in my bio :P), at least this will work as friction from wasting time there, also I gotta focus more on my studies cause Boards, JEE all is here.

1. Now let's come into Programming or Coding Stuff which I have decided to learn in 2023. (for which you are probably here)
